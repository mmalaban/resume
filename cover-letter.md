Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Embedded Software (Middleware) Engineer position at Applied EV. I have over 10 years of automotive industry experience and extensive expertise in embedded software development, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to creating the future of mobility with SDV driverless transport.

My automotive experience has uniquely qualified me for this role. Throughout my career at IAV Inc. and BorgWarner Inc., I have led cross-functional software teams in developing safety-critical embedded software systems that comply with ISO 26262 and ASPICE standards, same frameworks Applied EV follows. I have taken full ownership of AUTOSAR diagnostic stacks, middleware development, and BSW configuration, while leading board bring-up activities for multiple microcontroller platforms including Infineon TriCore, NXP S32K, and STM32 systems.

My extensive embedded software development experience spans the complete software development lifecycle, from requirements analysis through implementation, testing, and release management. I have hands-on expertise with the tools and technologies Applied EV utilizes, including C/C++, Vector toolsets (DaVinci tools, CANanalyzer and CANoe), Lauterbach TRACE32, Git, and Polarion. I have proven experience with UDS diagnostics, CAN, and FlexRay protocols directly align with your technical requirements. My experience leading cybersecurity, diagnostics, and integration teams has prepared me to take ownership of middleware stack delivery and support integration activities as outlined in your job description.

Beyond my technical qualifications, I am eager to relocate to Australia and contribute to Applied EV's dynamic team. I am fully committed to making this transition and excited about the prospect of bringing my automotive expertise to support Applied EV's growth in the global mobility market.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my proven track record in automotive embedded software development, team leadership experience, and my excitement to contribute to Applied EV's continued success.

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you soon!

Sincerely,
Melvin Malabanan
